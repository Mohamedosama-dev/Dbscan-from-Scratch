# Dbscan-from-Scratch
#In this project i make dbscan on iris dataset and get
core point , border points ,noise points in dataset and
calculate number of them and plot points we use pca
before dbscan to make it more efficient and calculate
accuracy

Conclusion
1- When we reduce number of eps and reduce
number of min samples the noise points are
increased
2- When we increase number of eps and reduce
number of min samples Number of core points
increase
3- PCA can help reduce the dimensionality of the
data while preserving the important
characteristics of the data. By reducing the
dimensionality of the data, PCA can help to
mitigate the curse of dimensionality, which
refers to the problem where the performance
of many machine learning algorithms
deteriorates as the number of features or
dimensions increases.
4- DBSCAN can be effective on the Iris dataset
because the dataset has clear clusters, with
three different species of flowers represented.
The algorithm can be used to group together
flowers that have similar measurements,
potentially leading to insights about the
relationships between the different species.
